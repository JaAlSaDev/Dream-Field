# 2. Game Elements
## 1. Aesthetics
*Aesthetics* describe the look, sound, and feel of a game.

For the time being, Dream Field contains visuals only, and one sound effect for the start screen.

## 2. Mechanics
*Mechanics* are the rules of a game. They describe the ways in which a player can reach a goal.

A player can only win the game if they defeat the other player. Players can execute the following actions:
* **Attack**: Players can attack each other using long-range and short-range attacks.
* **Move**: Players can move on the grid horizontally or vertically.




## 3. Technology
*Technology* refers to the medium that the rest of the game elements take place in.
1. **Design**: 
 * **Pen and Paper**: Prototyping screens, game mechanics, and artwork.
 * [**Figma**](): Prototyping screens.
 * [**Krita**](https://krita.org/en/): Artwork.
 * [**draw.io**](https://drawio-app.com/): UML diagrams.
 
2. **Implementation**:
 * **Javascript**: Game mechanics, controls, [Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API/Using_the_Gamepad_API "Gamepad API").
 * [**jQuery**](https://jquery.com/ "**jQuery**"): Screen transitions, character frame transitions.
 * [**Parcel**](https://parceljs.org/): Web application bundler.
 * **CSS**: Styling.
 * **HTML**: Website structure.

# 5. Future Work
I'd like to add the following to my game:
* Music and sound effects.
* Environments changing in sync with music (diverse background images and panels).
* Enemy AI.
* More characters.
* Code refactoring.
* Online VS mode.

# 6. Bugs and Errors
* Character image overlaps with other objects in the environment.
* Transition between character frames is delayed sometimes.
