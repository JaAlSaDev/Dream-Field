# 2. Game Elements
## 1. Aesthetics
*Aesthetics* describe the look, sound, and feel of a game.

For the time being, Dream Field contains visuals only.

## 2. Mechanics
*Mechanics* are the rules of a game. They describe the ways in which a player can reach a goal.

A player can only win the game if they defeat the other player. Players can execute the following actions:
* Attack: Players can attack each other using long-range and short-range attacks.
* Move: Players can move on the grid horizontally or vertically.




## 3. Technology
*Technology* refers to the medium that the rest of the game elements take place in.
* Javascript (jQuery): Game rules, controls, and gamepad.
* CSS: Styling
* HTML: Website structure.
* Figma: Prototyping screens.
* Pen and paper: Prototyping screens, game mechanics, and artwork.
* Krita: Artwork.

## 4. Story
None
# 3. Instructions
The game requires two gamepads to work. Before starting the game, do the following:
1. Hover on the page.
2. Connect two controllers.
3. Mash the buttons on both controllers.
4. Press and hold the start button for a bit.

If the bottom bars starts to fill, that means the game started.
If the above steps don't work, refresh the page, and try again.

* Enemy AI.
* More characters.
* Code refactoring.

# 6. Bugs and Errors
* Character image overlaps with other objects in the environment.
* Transition between character frames is delayed sometimes.
* Gamepads sometimes don't connect.
